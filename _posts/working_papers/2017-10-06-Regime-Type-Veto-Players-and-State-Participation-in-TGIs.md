Initiatives"

Why do states use informal institutions to govern global problems? Extant research on the forms
of institutionalization in global governance focuses on formal modes of cooperation, such as formal
intergovernmental organizations (FIGOs) and treaties. Formal rules, however, are often inadequate,
if not entirely misleading, descriptions of the game that actors play in world politics. Recent work on
informal global governance largely focuses on informal governance within FIGOs. Little is known
about informal governance outside FIGOs. This paper starts to fill this gap. I focus on a particular
type of informal global governance; namely, transnational public-private governance initiatives
(TGIs) in which states and/or FIGOs cooperate with business and civil society actors. I argue that
statesâ€™ choice to participate in TGIs is driven by forces at the domestic level. Specifically, I argue that
the extent to which a state participates in TGIs depends on its political regime type and the presence of
domestic veto players. The added value of the flexibility and low legal rigidity of cooperation based
on TGIs allows democratic leaders to avoid the cumbersome domestic ratification processes of international
agreements. It also allows governments irrespective of their regime type to bypass domestic
veto players with opposing preferences. The push toward informal global governance that originates
in the presence of domestic veto players, however, decreases as the level of democracy in a country
increases. I empirically test my argument using a new dataset with information on 468 TGIs between
1885 and 2016. Results suggest that state participation in TGIs is strongly driven by domestic politics.
