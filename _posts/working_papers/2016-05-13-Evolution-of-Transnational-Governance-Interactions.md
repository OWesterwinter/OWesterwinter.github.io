title: "The Evolution of Transnational Governance Interactions: A Network Approach"
category: ["Working paper"]
---
Transnational public-private governance initiatives (TGIs) in which governments, business,
and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) cooperate to regulate the negative externalities
of global corporate and state conduct have become an important element of world politics. In
a broad range of issue areas, TGIs co-exist with other TGIs. This co-existence of governance
arrangements creates ample room for inter-institutional interactions. However, while in some
issue areas the interactions among TGIs have been rapidly growing over time, in others they
have been characterized by a more mixed pattern of growth and decline, and in still others
they have remained at a low level throughout. In addition, we observe wide variation in the
quality of interactions among TGIs as well as between TGIs and other forms of governance,
ranging from coordination and cooperation to competition for participants, resources, and
inuence. In this paper, I use a network approach to empirically model the factors underlying
the evolution of interactions among TGIs across issue areas and over time. The data for my
analysis comes from a new dataset on international cooperation that includes detailed information on more than 250 TGIs in a broad range of issue areas.
