Over the past ten years a large number of studies has explored the diusion of bilateral
and regional economic agreements. A related stream of research has formally theorized and
empirically demonstrated the interdependence between dierent dimensions of the design of
international institutions, in particular, the positive correlation between depth and exibility.
We make a rst attempt to link these two literatures. Our argument is that trade-related
regulations diuse from one preferential trade agreement (PTA) to another as a result of
competition among states. The resulting diusion of depth-related provisions simultaneously
impacts also the exibility and enforcement dimensions of PTA design. Concretely, countries
that adopt deep trade-related regulations from competitors also have incentives to include escape clauses to mitigate costs of compliance and dispute mechanisms to stabilize cooperation.
We test our hypotheses using an original dataset on the design of 587 PTAs from 1985 to 2009
and relying on statistical network analysis. Our paper contributes to the literatures on international cooperation, the political economy of trade, and the rational design of international
institutions.
