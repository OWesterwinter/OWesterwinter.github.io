title: "Measuring Transnational Public-Private Governance Initiatives in World Politics: A New Dataset"
category: ["Working paper"]
---
This paper summarizes the Transnational Public-Private Governance Initiatives in World Politics Data. The data contains detailed information on the scope, membership, and institutional
design of 481 transnational publi-private governance initiatives (TGIs) in which states and/or
formal intergovernmental organizations cooperate with business and civil society actors to
govern global problems. I provide detailed descriptions of the sample generation and discuss
coding rules. I also map the development of TGIs at the initiative and state level of analysis
and show how the new data contributes to enhancing researchers' understanding of transnational public-private governance. The paper concludes by identifying puzzles and avenues for
future research on transnational public-private governance in world politics.
