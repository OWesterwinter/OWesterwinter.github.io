title: "Measuring Transnational Public-Private Governance Initiatives in World Politics: A New Dataset"
category: ["Working paper"]
---
This paper summarizes the Transnational Public-Private Governance Initiatives in World Politics
Data. The data contains detailed information on the scope, participants, and institutional
design of 468 transnational public-private governance initiatives (TGIs) in which states and/or
formal intergovernmental organizations cooperate with business and civil society actors to
govern global problems. I describe the sample generation and discuss coding rules. I also
map the development of TGIs at the initiative and state level of analysis, and show how the
new data contributes to enhancing researchersâ€™ understanding of transnational public-private
governance. The paper concludes by identifying puzzles and avenues for future research on
transnational public-private governance initiatives in world politics.
