They are even less able to explain why contemporary governance schemes involve the various actors and take the many forms they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Juxtaposing the insights of scholars writing about new modes of governance with the logic of network theory, The New Power Politics offers a framework for understanding contemporary security governance and its variation. The framework rests on a fresh view of power and how it works in global politics. Though power is integral to governance, it is something that emerges from, and depends on, relationships. Thus, power is dynamic; it is something that governors must continually cultivate with a wide range of consequential global players, and how a governor uses power in one situation can have consequences for her future relationships, and thus, future power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding this new power politics is crucial for explaining and shaping the future of global security politics.&lt;/p&gt;

Network analysis allows researchers to develop a better understanding of the causal dynamics and structural geometry of the complex web of interdependencies at work in the onset, incidence, and diffusion of conflict and peace. This issue features new theoretical and empirical research demonstrating how properly accounting for networked interdependencies has profound implications for our understanding of the processes thought to be responsible for the conflict behavior of state and non-state actors. The contributors examine the variation in networks of states and transnational actors to explain outcomes related to international conflict and peace. They highlight how networked interdependencies affect conflict and cooperation in a broad range of areas at the center of international relations scholarship. It is helpful to distinguish between three uses of networks, namely: (1) as theoretical tools, (2) as measurement tools, and (3) as inferential tools. The introduction discusses each of these uses and shows how the contributions rely on one or several of them. Next, Monte Carlo simulations are used to illustrate one of the strengths of network analysis, namely that it helps researchers avoid biased inferences when the data generating process underlying the observed data contains extradyadic interdependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

While many view trade as pacifying, others argue that dependencies increase friction and the risk of war. We provide a theory that explains how cross-border economic ties alternately enhance or impede international cooperation. Three main factors account for the heterogeneous effects of trade on conflict: interdependence, asymmetry, and multipolarity. Interdependence can act as a substitute for, or as a deterrent to, militarized violence. In the former case, interdependence actually increases more modest non-militarized conflict, while also discouraging militarized disputes. Asymmetry diminishes the conflict-inhibiting effect of trade ties, as dependency cannot simultaneously be used to coerce and to inform. Multilateral trade networks alternately moderate or enhance the bilateral effects of interdependence and asymmetry on interstate peace. Our theory and evidence reveal complex, cross-cutting consequences of economic interdependence on conflict behavior and also demonstrate effects well beyond the dyad, suggesting the need to include extradyadic ties in future theoretical and empirical research studying the commercial peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why have states recently started to use informal institutions instead of formal organisations to govern global policy issues? Extant research on the forms of institutionalisation in global governance focuses on formal modes of cooperation, such as intergovernmental organisations and treaties. Formal rules, however, do not exhaust the institutional variety of international and transnational cooperation. They are often inadequate descriptions of the game that actors play in world politics. Recent work in political science, economics, and international law has started to examine informal governance as a mode of international cooperation. Informal governance refers to unwritten - and often vaguely specified - rules and norms that are not enshrined in formally constituted organisations and which modify or substitute legally binding rules. This project examines the factors that lead states and transnational actors to choose between formal intergovernmental organisations, informal intergovernmental organisations and transnational governance networks to structure their interactions and govern global problems. The research team will also investigate the interactions between formal and informal institutions. The project highlights the political dimensions of informal governance and argues that distributional conflict and power asymmetries are critical for the selection and design of informal institutions. States and transnational actors use informal institutions as a means to project power and influence outcomes according to their particularistic interests. This project will fill an important gap in research on international cooperation and global governance by taking systematic account of the wider spectrum of institutional variation. Furthermore, the accurate knowledge about the factors that shape the emergence and functioning of informal forms of governing will help policy-makers to effectively provide public goods and enhance the legitimacy, equity, and efficiency of global governance institutions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Oliver Westerwinter, PhD</name><email>oliver.westerwinter@unisg.ch</email></author><category term="[&quot;Research&quot;, &quot;Work in progress&quot;]" /><summary>What are the factors that lead states and transnational actors to choose between formal intergovernmental organisations, informal intergovernmental organisations and transnational governance networks to structure their interactions and govern global problems?</summary></entry><entry><title>Formal and Informal Governance in the UN Peacebuilding Commission</title><link href="http://oliverwesterwinter.com/chapters/UN-Peacebuilding-Commision/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Formal and Informal Governance in the UN Peacebuilding Commission" /><published>2013-12-31T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2013-12-31T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://oliverwesterwinter.com/chapters/UN-Peacebuilding-Commision</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://oliverwesterwinter.com/chapters/UN-Peacebuilding-Commision/">&lt;p&gt;Post-conflict peacebuilding — understood as efforts undertaken at the end of a civil war to create conditions under which peace is consolidated and violence will not recur (Boutros-Ghali 1992: 15) — has traditionally been a matter of states and intergovernmental organizations (IGOs).1 National governments consult with their international partners to develop and implement projects aimed at the political, economic, and social reconstruction of war-torn societies. Non-state actors, particularly local civil society organizations and armed groups, are usually considered addressees of post-conflict recovery programs. The new generation of peacebuilding operations, however, goes beyond this intergovernmental approach (Otobo 2009, Paris 2009, Paris and Sisk 2009). Not only a variety of actors including the United Nations (UN) but also many Western governments and donor organizations have acknowledged that the exclusion of non-state actors is problematic, and they have started to promote local ownership as a new guiding principle of post-conflict governance (e.g. OECD Paris Declaration 2005). As a result, there has been a rapid growth in the involvement of non-state actors in post-conflict peacebuilding both at the international and domestic level. The frequency, scope, and depth of non-state-actor involvement has changed, ranging from assistance in the implementation of projects to participation in decision-making and monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

They are not concluded in formal international organizations. They frequently involve actors other than formal state representatives. In the realm of finance, health, security, or the environment, international lawmaking is increasingly ‘informal’: It takes place in networks or loosely organized fora; it involves a multitude of stakeholders including regulators, experts, professional organizations and other non-state actors; it leads to guidelines, standards or best practices. This book critically assesses the concept of informal international lawmaking, its legal nature, and impact at the national and international level. It examines whether it is on the rise, as is often claimed, and if so, what the implications of this are. It addresses what actors are involved in its creation, the processes utilized, and the informal output produced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book frames informal international lawmaking around three axes: output informality (novel types of norms), process informality (norm-making in networks outside international organizations), and actor informality (the involvement of public agencies and regulators, private actors, and international organizations). Fundamentally, the book is concerned with whether this informality causes problems in terms of keeping transnational lawmaking accountable. By empirically analysing domestic processes of norm elaboration and implementation, the book addresses the key question of how to benefit from the effectiveness of informal international lawmaking without jeopardizing the accountability necessary in the process of making law.&lt;/p&gt;
