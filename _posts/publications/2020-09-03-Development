The global governance of development increasingly relies on multi-stakeholder partnerships
between states, intergovernmental organizations, and non-governmental organizations.
This article takes on two tasks. The first is to describe quantitatively the
institutional evolution of the multilateral development system over the past century.
The second is to juxtapose four rational-institutionalist explanations for why states
establish new organizations as transnational governance initiativesâ€”functionalism,
power-oriented theories, domestic politics, and contextual design. The empirical analysis
probes these explanations using the new Transnational Public-Private Governance
Initiatives in World Politics dataset, which combines several existing data sources to
build the most comprehensive data on different forms of institutionalized cooperation in
global governance. The results lend most support to the contextual design view, while
also yielding support for other accounts. By employing Heckman selection models, the
analysis addresses potential selection bias due to unobserved correlation between state
choices to create a new organization and its design. A qualitative case study further
validates measurement choices and causal mechanisms. These findings have implications
for theories of institutional design and development practice, specifically regarding
the role of intergovernmental organizations in an increasingly interconnected world.
