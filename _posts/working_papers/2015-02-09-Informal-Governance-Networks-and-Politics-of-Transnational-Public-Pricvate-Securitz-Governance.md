Transnational institutions in which states, firms, and NGOs cooperate to govern the
negative externalities of global corporate conduct vary in their institutional designs.
Although these regulatory regimes are typically concerned with prisoners’ dilemma-like
problems, they often lack the institutional structures required for effectively dealing
with them. Rational choice-based theories of international cooperation are weak in
explaining such inefficient institutions. I propose a political model of transnational
institutional design that places distributional conflict and power asymmetries at the
center of analysis. I argue that states, firms, and NGOs use multiple power variants,
such as economic, institutional, and network power, to secure favorable institutional
choices and that the extent to which different forms of power are effective and efficient
means of influence is conditioned by the formality of the institutional context in which
bargaining takes place. Integrating case study techniques and network analysis, I draw
on data from the Kimberley Process on the regulation of “blood diamonds” to probe
the explanatory power of my model.
