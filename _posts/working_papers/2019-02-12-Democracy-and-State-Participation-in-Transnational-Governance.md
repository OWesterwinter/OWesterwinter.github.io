title: "Who Joins? Democracy and State Participation in Transnational Governance"
category: ["Working paper", "frontpage"]
---
I offer a systematic account of the effect of democracy on countriesâ€™ participation in transnational
public-private governance initiatives (TGIs) in which states and/or intergovernmental
organizations cooperate with business and civil society actors. First, I argue that governments
of democratic political regimes have incentives to join TGIs because of the demand and availability
of non-state actors at the domestic level to participate in global governance institutions
that grant access to them. Democratic governments also use TGIs as foreign policy instruments
because they provide them with strategic advantages in bargaining and allow them to project
elements of good governance from the domestic to the global realm. Second, I posit that the
strategic incentive of democratic governments to become involved in TGIs is most pronounced
in issue areas in which non-state actors are numerous and active, and weaker in areas in which
they are less prominent. I test these arguments using new data on state participation in 636
transnational public-private governance initiatives in 2015. The results support my expectations.
