We offer a systematic account of the effect of states’ reputation on the occurrence and design
of international cooperation. When confronted with states with a bad cooperation reputation,
i.e. states who reneged on their international commitments in the past, states have to decide
whether to cooperate and, if cooperation is attempted, how to design it in order to mitigate costs
and enhance benefits. The choice between formal and informal institutional arrangements allows
states to reap the benefits of cooperation and to reduce the costs because it provides them
with design elements that protect them from the costs of their partner’s defection. We test
our argument using new data on formal and informal international institutions in the trade and
commerce area in the period 1940 to 2014. We find that reputation has a strong impact on the
occurrence and design of international cooperation and that this effect is shaped by power.
