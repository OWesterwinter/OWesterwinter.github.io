Why do states ght if conict is costly and inecient? Bargaining theories of war emphasize
the role of asymmetric information as a fundamental cause of conict. Leaders uncertain about
one another's military strength, preferences, or resolve can err in calculating the expected
costs and outcomes of ghting which can lead to war. A critical step in the onset of conict
is thus determining what leaders are likely to know, and where they get their information
from. Who one knows may help to shape what one knows; we explore the role of networks in
shaping conict dynamics in situations where ghting results from uncertainty. If networks
(e.g. diplomatic exchanges, trade) mitigate uncertainty and private information, then states'
network positions should be an important predictor of the onset of international conict. We
develop a theoretical model that links the variance/co-variance structure of errors to conict
onset and derive hypotheses about how the network positions of individual states and dyads
aects uncertainty and conict onset. We test these hypotheses against data on militarized
interstate dispute onsets between 1950 and 2000 using network and coventional econometric
models.
