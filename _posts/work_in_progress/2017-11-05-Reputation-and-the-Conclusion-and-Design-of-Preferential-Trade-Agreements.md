We offer a systematic account of the effect of states’ reputation on the occurrence and institutional design
of international cooperation. We argue that when confronted with states with a bad reputation, i.e. states
who reneged on their international commitments in the past, states have to decide whether to cooperate
or not and, if cooperation is attempted, how to design it in order to mitigate costs and enhance benefits.
The choice between formal and informal institutional arrangements allows states to reap the benefits of
cooperation, while at the same time reducing its expected costs because it provides them with design
elements that protect them from the costs of their partner’s defection. We test our argument using new
data on formal and informal international institutions in the trade and commerce area in the period 1940
to 2014. Our findings show that reputation has a strong impact on the occurrence and design of international
cooperation and that this effect is shaped by power and time.
